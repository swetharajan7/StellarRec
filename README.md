StellarRec is a revolutionary AI-powered platform that streamlines the university recommendation letter process. Instead of writing multiple letters for different universities, recommenders can upload one high-quality letter and seamlessly distribute it to multiple institutions, saving hours of work while boosting student application success rates.

# The Problem We Solve
Time-consuming repetition: Recommenders traditionally write separate letters for each university
Inconsistent quality: Multiple letters may vary in quality and content
Administrative burden: Complex submission processes across different university portals
Limited reach: Students often limit applications due to recommendation letter bottlenecks

# Our Solution
StellarRec transforms recommendation letters from a manual, repetitive process into an intelligent, scalable system that benefits all stakeholders in the university application ecosystem.

StellarRec is a productivity and workflow tool designed to save time, reduce friction, and simplify the college application experience. With AI-powered support, student recommendations become streamlined and smartâ€”allowing recommenders to manage letters for multiple universities and applicants without redundancy. By centralizing the process, StellarRec not only saves valuable time for students and mentors but also reduces stress, improves acceptance rates, and makes the entire application journey more accessible and transparent.
