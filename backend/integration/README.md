# StellarRec System Integration

This directory contains the system integration layer that connects all microservices and ensures they work together seamlessly.

## Overview

The integration layer provides:
- Service orchestration and coordination
- Cross-service data consistency validation
- End-to-end workflow testing
- System health monitoring
- Transaction integrity verification
- Load testing with realistic scenarios
- Security penetration testing

## Components

### Service Orchestrator
- Coordinates complex workflows across multiple services
- Manages distributed transactions
- Handles service dependencies and startup order
- Provides circuit breaker patterns for resilience

### Integration Testing Framework
- End-to-end user workflow tests
- Cross-service data consistency validation
- Performance testing under load
- Security vulnerability scanning
- API contract testing

### System Monitoring
- Real-time health checks across all services
- Performance metrics aggregation
- Error tracking and alerting
- Distributed tracing
- Service dependency mapping

## Usage

```bash
# Run full system integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Start all services in correct order
npm run start:all

# Run load testing
npm run test:load

# Run security tests
npm run test:security

# Generate system health report
npm run health:report
```

## Architecture

The integration layer follows these principles:
- Loose coupling between services
- Event-driven communication
- Graceful degradation
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Distributed transaction management
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability
