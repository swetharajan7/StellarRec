# StellarRec Production Deployment

This directory contains all production deployment configurations, monitoring setup, and operational procedures for the StellarRec platform.

## Overview

The production deployment includes:
- Kubernetes configurations for all microservices
- Terraform infrastructure as code
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Blue-green deployment configurations
- Operational runbooks and incident response

## Architecture

### Production Environment
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS (multi-region deployment)
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes (EKS)
- **Database**: Amazon RDS PostgreSQL with read replicas
- **Cache**: Amazon ElastiCache Redis
- **Search**: Amazon OpenSearch
- **Storage**: Amazon S3 with CloudFront CDN
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

### High Availability
- Multi-AZ deployment across 3 availability zones
- Auto-scaling groups for all services
- Load balancers with health checks
- Database failover and read replicas
- Redis cluster mode for cache redundancy

### Security
- VPC with private subnets for services
- WAF protection at the edge
- SSL/TLS encryption everywhere
- Secrets management with AWS Secrets Manager
- IAM roles and policies for least privilege access

## Deployment Process

1. **Pre-deployment Checks**
   - Run integration tests
   - Validate configurations
   - Check resource availability

2. **Blue-Green Deployment**
   - Deploy to green environment
   - Run smoke tests
   - Switch traffic gradually
   - Monitor metrics and rollback if needed

3. **Post-deployment Validation**
   - Health checks across all services
   - Performance validation
   - Security scan
   - User acceptance testing

## Monitoring and Alerting

- **Application Metrics**: Response times, error rates, throughput
- **Infrastructure Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk, network
- **Business Metrics**: User registrations, applications submitted
- **Security Metrics**: Failed logins, suspicious activity
- **Custom Dashboards**: Service-specific monitoring

## Backup and Recovery

- **Database Backups**: Automated daily backups with 30-day retention
- **File Storage**: Cross-region replication
- **Configuration Backups**: Version-controlled infrastructure
- **Disaster Recovery**: RTO < 4 hours, RPO < 1 hour
